      "publisher": "Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC)",
      "releaseDate": "2021-09-05",
      "summary": "Many IoT applications rely on data streams, flowing from producers to consumers. Typically, Named Data Networking has been designed to manipulate directly data chunks, and is particularly relevant in IoT networks. However, in multitenant networks, privacy is a major concern, and producers may refuse to share the personal data they generate with non trusted stakeholders. To guarantee k-anonymity, producers can require their data to be aggregated with the one of other producers. We propose here a routing scheme based on aggregation, relying on a pub-sub approach. By appropriately constructing and querying the set of offers, i.e. the list of data streams that are collected, aggregated and transformed together, our routing aggregation scheme provides a privacy aware large-scale interconnection, where the consumer does not access directly to individual measurements. Our performance evaluation highlights the flexibility of our solution to accommodate a large set of queries, while still respecting privacy.",

      "summary": "Smart Cities rely on a broad variety of services generating an heterogeneous traffic load, and having diverse privacy and performance requirements. In this paper, we focus on mobility services for an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), where several applications inter-operate by sharing information. In particular, we consider three main services: ride-hailing, smart parkings and traffic regulation. To investigate the load generated by these mobility services, we rely on two real datasets. Our goal is to study whether a given technology can scale with realistic conditions related to the envisioned smart mobility scenario. In particular, we analyze here how many LoRa gateways are necessary and how they should be deployed to support these mobility services. We highlight the bottlenecks occurring in most dense areas of the network and argue that heterogeneous deployments can efficiently handle such hot spots.",

      "releaseDate": "2020-11-26",
      "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) interconnects a large collection of low power devices to the Internet. Instead of relying on the usual approach where IoT devices push their data to a cloud, we envision a decentralized approach, where multiple IoT domains cooperate to exchange data safely. As privacy is critical regarding IoT data, each domain should define what it accepts to export. We propose to create a multi-domain overlay of border routers, defining their own privacy constraints. Border routers export their available data streams and policies to their peering domains. Such policies define how streams should be aggregated and transformed to be compliant with the privacy requirements. We take advantage of the Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture to enable data re-usability and in-network transformations. Our evaluation highlights the scalability of our approach: NDN content stores supporting data aggregation and transformation reduce both the network and the cache load while enforcing privacy natively.",

      "summary": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to integrate a large number of sensors, and actuators to the Internet. Multiple concurrent applications may cohabit on top of the same IoT infrastructure, and may re-use the same data for various purpose. However, privacy represents a major concern for many IoT applications, such as in smart building and healthcare. We propose here a multi-domain IoT framework where each domain aggregates distinct data-streams to respect their privacy concerns. We argue that removing sensitive metadata and aggregating values reported by each data-stream is sufficient to hide individual private measurements. Moreover, relying on the Named Data Networking (NDN) paradigm, we can exploit caching strategies and perform in-network processing to ensure both scalability and privacy. In this paper, we discuss the necessary mechanisms to design a scalable inter-domain, privacy aware NDN scheme.",

To access this cyber environment, scientific researchers do not have to become computer experts. In particular, we assume that scientific researchers provide a description of the problem as an input to the cyber environment and then get their results without being responsible for managing the computational resources. We provide a prototype of the architecture and introduce an evaluation which studies a real workload of scientific applications executions. The results show the advantages of the proposed architecture. Besides, we highlight this work provides guidelines for developing cyber environments focused on e-Science.",

      "releaseDate": "2014-11-12",
      "summary": "Wireless Mesh Networks have the potential to serve as an all-wireless backbone. They represent a key building block of the new Internet of Things to collect all the traffic. However, IEEE 802.11 performs very poorly in multi-hop topologies leading to unfairness and a poor throughput. Thus, the standard IEEE 802.11s proposes to re-use the IEEE 802.11 medium access in a mesh multi-hop topology while using a routing protocol to create routes at the layer 2. IEEE 802.11s may exploit multi-channel multi-interface wireless routers to increase the through-put. In particular, the routing protocol must select carefully the forwarders to limit inter- and intra-flow interference. In this paper, we propose to fully characterize the performance of IEEE 802.11s when using multi-interface nodes, and to isolate some key performance issues. We also propose some key mechanisms that must be implemented to solve these pathological cases and to improve the throughput.",
